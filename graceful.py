  Find a graceful labeling for T

  A labeling of a tree on n vertices is an assignment of 0,1,...,n-1 to the vertices
  A labeling is graceful if no two vertices share a label,
  and each edge has a unique positive difference between the labels of its neighbors.

  The Graceful Labeling Conjecture (also the Ringel-Kotzig conjecture)
  posits that all trees have graceful labelings
  
  Is the problem of finding a graceful labeling NP-complete?
